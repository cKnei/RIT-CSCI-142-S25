Java Problems

For each of the numbered problems:
- State whether the problem occurs at compile-time or run-time
- Briefly describe what the problem is in plain English

1.  Comp-Time | Class name doesn't match file name
2.  Comp-Time | .next method returns String type, not int type
3.  Run-Time  | Division by zero error
4.  Comp-Time | Faulty method argument declaration (Missing type)
5.  Comp-Time | Method has to return int, there is a path where it doesn't
6.  Run-Time  | ArrayList was initialized, but has no values
7.  Comp-Time | char is declared via '', not "", which is a String
8.  Comp-Time | Variable j was never initialized
9.  Comp-Time | Variable is declared as float, while provided a double
10. Run-Time  | End index 12 is out of bounds for string length 12 (0-based index, sorry lua)
